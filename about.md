A System administrator who is excited about DevOps principles and CM (Ansible) applied to HPC. I enjoy software development of all kinds, ranging from web development, mobile apps, to firmware level on embedded systems. I try to balance my time at the computer with outdoor recreational hobbies like hiking, rock climbing, and snowboarding.
